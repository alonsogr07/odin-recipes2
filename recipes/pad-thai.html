            <li>¼ cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

            <li>2 limes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried red chili flakes</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak rice vermicelli noodles in a bowl filled with hot water until softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat peanut oil over medium heat in a large wok.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir tofu in the wok, turning the pieces until they are golden on all sides.</li>
            <li>Remove tofu with a slotted spoon and drain on plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Pour all but 1 tablespoon of used oil from the wok into a small bowl; it will be used again in a later step.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the wok over medium heat until it starts to sizzle.</li>
            <li>Pour in beaten egg and lightly toss in the hot oil to scramble the egg.</li>
            <li>Remove egg from the wok and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour reserved peanut oil in the small bowl back into the wok.</li>
            <li>Toss garlic and drained noodles in wok until they are coated with oil.</li>
            <li>Stir in vegetable broth, lime juice, soy sauce, and sugar. Toss and gently push noodles around the pan to coat with sauce.</li>
            <li>Gently mix in tofu, scrambled egg, salt, chili flakes, and 3 tablespoons peanuts; toss to mix all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix in bean sprouts and green onions, reserving about 1 tablespoon of each for garnish. Cook and stir until bean sprouts have softened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange noodles on a warm serving platter and garnish with 3 tablespoons peanuts and reserved bean sprouts and green onions. Place lime wedges around the edges of the platter.</li>
